/*
2. Implement the App: 
○ Create a file named app.js. 
○ Use yargs to parse a --city argument provided by the user. 
○ Simulate fetching weather data by returning a hardcoded response for different cities. 
○ Use chalk to style the output, emphasizing the city name and weather details. 
*/
const yargs = require('yargs');
const chalk = require('chalk');
/*
3. Understand Dependency Management: 
○ Review the package.json file and identify where the installed dependencies are listed. 
○ Explain the role of the node_modules directory and why it should not be included in version control. 
○ Create a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it. 
*/

/*
4. Test the App: 
○ Run the app with a city name argument (e.g., node app.js --city="New York"). 
○ Ensure it displays the correct simulated weather data. 

5. Simulate Dependency Issues: 
○ Delete the node_modules folder. 
○ Use npm install to reinstall all dependencies from package.json. 
○ Verify the app still works correctly. 

Expected Deliverables 
1. A functioning weather-app project with: 
○ app.js implementing the functionality described. 
○ Properly listed dependencies in package.json. 
○ .gitignore file excluding node_modules. 

2. A short written response commented within the code, addressing: 
○ The purpose of package.json in managing dependencies. 
○ Why node_modules should not be included in version control. 
○ How npm install reinstalls dependencies and its importance in collaborative projects.
